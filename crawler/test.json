The MHCI is a two-year master\u2019s program that spans 12 months. During the first semester, students learn core knowledge in programming, design, psychology and HCI methods. During the second and third semesters, the students can choose from diverse electives across the university while they participate in a substantial industry capstone project with an external client.\nAt the end of 12 months, our students go on to successful careers where they lead and collaborate in the design and implementation of effective, efficient, and desirable software and technical systems. They are poised to contribute to multidisciplinary teams that typically develop software, technical systems and interfaces. They are broadly knowledgeable about the techniques for building successful user interfaces, the design principles that make user interfaces visually clear and appealing, and the techniques for identifying needs for software, its success, and the people and organizations that will use their systems.\nSince 1994, our program has graduated more than 600 students. The in-depth interdisciplinary experiences here at Carnegie Mellon make our students the glue between design, development and management in many companies. The MHCI student is often hired to play one role, but quickly becomes an indispensable team player\u00a0\u2014 in many cases, a team leader for research, design and strategy in software, technical or consulting engagements.\nNicole Willis\nAssociate Director of MHCI\nHuman-Computer Interaction Institute\nCarnegie Mellon University\n300 S.

The integrated discipline of computational biology/bioinformatics represents the application of modern computer science, statistics, and mathematics to exploring biological and biomedical problems. The Department of Biological Sciences in the Mellon College of Science and the Computational Biology Department in the School of Computer Science combine their world-class strengths in computer science and biology with the strong tradition of interdisciplinary research at Carnegie Mellon into a unique training program in this emerging field.\nThe M.S. in Computational Biology program enrolls students who desire a more immediate career in industry or who wish to explore computational biology without committing to a doctoral program. It also draws returning professionals who seek to enhance their skills and practices in this new interdisciplinary field.\nCoursework consists of Foundation Courses, Background Courses, and Breadth & Depth Courses, as well as a number of electives in a wide array of disciplines such as computer science, machine learning, math, statistics, biology, chemistry, biomedical engineering, and information management. Students have the option of conducting in-depth research in addition to coursework, and are also encouraged to seek external internships after their first year. Students pursue this degree full-time and complete the program in 3-4 semesters.\nStudents who have completed the program have gone on to work in a wide range of industries as well as goverment and academic institutions. Recent graduates have been employed at companies and institutes such as the J. Craig Venter Institute, Life Technologies, Philips Research, and Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, to name a few. Other graduates have gone on to pursue Ph.D. degrees at a number of top universities around the world.\nStudent Spotlight: Sonia Chothani\n"}, {"url": "http://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/education/master/index.html", "dept": "Computer Science", "name": "Master of Science in Computer Science", "text": "Jump to navigation\n\nThe Computer Science Department offers three different master\u2019s options for students who have completed (or will complete) a bachelor\u2019s degree and want to extend their training in computer science. Our largest program is the M.S. in Computer Science, which allows students with undergraduate degrees in computer science or another technical field to work with their academic advisor to create their own course of study. We also offer a fifth-year master\u2019s program for current SCS undergraduates, and a 3-2 MBA program with CMU\u2019s Tepper School of Business.\nM.S. in Computer Science\nThe M.S. in Computer Science offers students with a bachelor's degree the opportunity to improve their training with advanced study in computer science.\u00a0 We cater to students with basic analytic skills and a strong aptitude for mathematics, programming, and logical reasoning.\u00a0 You don\u2019t need a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science specifically for the program, but a technical undergraduate background will set you up for success.\nOur program isn\u2019t based on a fixed set of courses. Instead, you\u2019ll construct your own course of study, in consultation with your advisor. The program consists entirely of coursework, and there is generally no research component.\nMost students will complete the program in three semesters, but if you\u2019re switching to computer science from another field, you may need an additional semester to fill gaps in your undergraduate training. The M.S. program is distinct from the Ph.D. program in computer science, and master's students will not usually continue into the Ph.D. program and will not receive preferential treatment if they apply.\nFifth Year Masters Program\nWe designed the Fifth Year Masters Program specifically for students receiving a B.S. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon. The program encourages our very brightest undergraduates to become involved with research that broadens their undergraduate experience. We also want to encourage a select group of students to continue to graduate school by providing them with an additional qualification and period of study beyond their undergraduate degree, resulting in a master\u2019s degree in computer science.\nThe program usually lasts 12 months, including one normal academic year and one summer. Students will start working on a research project during the summer after their senior year, and continue that project while taking classes during the academic year. Students can only start the Fifth Year Masters program after they have received their B.S. in computer science at CMU.\nStudents interested in applying to the Fifth Year Master\u2019s Program should do so by the middle of the fall semester of their senior year. Students are admitted based on strong evidence of research potential through close interaction with one or more faculty members \u2014 whether in projects, summer jobs or advanced classes. In addition to support from their faculty sponsor, each student should have strong support from other faculty members who believe that the student shows great promise for doing research.\nAccelerated MBA Program\nStudents interested in earning their bachelor\u2019s degree and MBA in five years may be interested in the Tepper School of Business\u2019s Accelerated MBA program. The program is administered by the Tepper Schoool, and more information is available here.\nUndergraduate Programs\nThe admissions process for each undergraduate major varies from program to program, but admissions for our main bachelor of science in computer science are handled through Carnegie Mellon's central Office of Undergraduate Admission. Learn more on our Undergraduate Admissions page.\nMaster's Programs\nThe Computer Science Department offers a main M.S. in Computer Science, and applications for that program are submitted online by mid-December for fall admission the following year. Other master's programs available to CSD students have their own admissions processes. Learn more about our admissions requirements and processes here.\nDoctoral Programs\nThe Ph.D. in CS program uses the School of Computer Science online application for admissions. Applications are due in December for admittance the following fall. Students cannot begin in the spring.

It is only during manufacturing or after a deal has been consummated that physical goods must be moved.As a result, most improvements in business result from advances in information technology, a field that is changing so rapidly it is difficult even for professionals to keep up with it. It is always a question how to teach a subject that is constantly in flux.There is risk that the technical content will be obsolete by the end of the degree program, or shortly after its completion.Our philosophy is that professionals must learn not technology alone, but how to keep up with technology.An equally important precept of our program is that skills cannot be taught, but must be learned through practice.We follow these principles through a unique program specifically designed to produce eBusiness professionals. We do not offer traditional classes.While students are allowed to take a limited number of traditional elective courses in other departments, the MSIT eBusiness program does not offer courses of its own.We believe that the meta-skills required for success in the workplace, such as team building, time management, interpreting confusing or ambiguous assignments, professional writing and public speaking, can be acquired only through direct and extensive practice.Toward that end, the program consists first of 16 realistic eBusiness tasks that are so extensive they must be completed by teams.Accordingly, the students are initially divided into teams of five people who receive new tasks to perform every 2-3 weeks for 10 months. The students must produce professional deliverables, such as reports, technology analyses, business plans and system designs.Because the teams operate independently with minimal guidance, the students must learn to organize themselves, divide workload, become familiar with relevant technologies, and separate important from irrelevant reference material to complete the assigned work on schedule.Guiding the students through the program are three full-time Program Faculty, who work along with 11 other faculty members to ensure that everyone acquires the skills expected of our graduates. Many of our graduates aspire to be consultants, and consulting preparation is sound training for almost any information technology job.Therefore, to make the degree program as realistic as possible, all students become employees of a hypothetical company, ebConsultants LLP, for the 12-month duration of the program.As staff consultants, the students rotate through four assignments in each of the companys practices: Health Care, Financial, Retail and Logistics.Team composition changes at each transition, so the students have a chance to exercise their organizational skills at different times.To compress 10 months into a single sentence, the most crucial skill the students acquire is learning how to teach themselves. That skill is valuable for a lifetime and outlasts any conceivable shift in technology. The Practicum After the students have completed 16 eBusiness team tasks, they are already highly skilled consultants.To prove that to themselves and the faculty, the students are once again divided into teams to work on real problems of current interest furnished by actual industrial sponsors.These Practicum problems are tackled by teams of six students with the aid of two faculty advisors. The projects usually involve the design and implementation of an eBusiness system at least at the level of a prototype.This involves a requirements analysis, selection of a technology and consideration of alternative designs.The students must negotiate the scope of the project, achieve agreement on deliverables, and secure sponsor approval of interim deliverables.The last half of the Practicum is occupied with implementation, completion of written work product and refining presentations. The Practicum differs from the first 16 tasks in that it is much longer (9-10 weeks) and each team works on a different project.The main grading criterion is sponsor satisfaction, which is the ultimate goal of a consulting company.The sponsor has presented a problem  nothing less than an effective solution is acceptable. In addition to producing deliverables and providing an extensive briefing to the sponsor, each team makes a public presentation explaining the problem and its recommended solution, including a demonstration of a required software artifact.As an extra incentive, the presentations are judged by an independent panel of outside eBusiness experts.Each team is judged on the effectiveness of their solution and the quality of their presentation.The winning team receives a cash prize of $10,000. The Practicum provides an opportunity for students to work closely with a company on a problem of genuine importance.The company, in turn, has a chance to observe the students in a work situation, which may lead to a subsequent employment offer. Past Practicum sponsors have included Alcoa, American Eagle Outfitters, Johnson & Johnson, PNCBank, the Port of Pittsburgh and Wells Fargo.The results of several projects have been developed by sponsors into working eBusiness systems. Many students consider the Practicum to be the most useful and rewarding university experience of their lives. By the time they have completed this 17th and capstone project, the students are ready to face any challenge in the eBusiness sector. Diversity Our program is highly diverse and multicultural.The class of 2012 consists of 50 students from 14 different countries.The team nature of the program affords an unparalleled opportunity for students to work closely with others from a range of cultures and nationalities.We are particularly proud that 47% of our students are women. The School of Computer Science and Carnegie Mellon in general provide a hospitable environment for a multinational student body. Recruiting Recipients of professional degrees expect to secure suitable jobs after graduation.Toward that end, our program employs a full-time recruiter, Tami Radomski, to assist students in preparing resumes, learning interviewing skills, obtaining interviews and negotiating job offers.Students meet individually with Tami throughout the year to map out a personalized strategy for obtaining high-quality positions. Our graduates have gone on to become managers, programmers, business analysts and consultants, often in Silicon Valley.Some students have started companies of their own.

MSIT in Privacy Engineering The Master of Science in Information TechnologyPrivacy Engineering (MSIT-PE) degree is a one-year program designed for computer scientists and engineers who wish to pursue careers as privacy engineers or technical privacy managers. Designed in close collaboration with industry and government, this program is intended for students who aspire to play a critical role in building privacy into future products, services, and processes. This first-of-its kind program responds to the rapidly growing need for technical privacy expertise. As organizations develop new products, services, infrastructures and business processes that facilitate the collection and management of an ever-wider range of customer data, they are discovering that privacy issues need to be addressed from the very beginning of the design process. Over the past several years, both industry and government organizations have created positions for people responsible for ensuring that privacy is an integral part of the design process. These people are brought in as in-house consultants who work as part of multi-disciplinary teams. They have to understand technology and be able to integrate perspectives that span product design, software development, cyber security, human computer interaction, as well as business and legal considerations. Today organizations are already reporting a significant shortage of people who are adequately trained to play this increasingly crucial role, while demand is continuing to increase. The 12-month MSIT in Privacy Engineering program combines the best and most successful elements gleaned from Carnegie Mellon Universitys long and distinguished history of professional masters programs. Offered jointly by the School of Computer Science and College of Engineering, the program includes two semesters of courses taught by leading academic privacy and security experts. The program concludes with a summer-long learning-by-doing, capstone project, where students will be brought in as privacy consultants to work on client projects. Students who complete this program will be well prepared for jobs as privacy engineers and technical privacy managers. Starting in the 2013-2014 academic year, thanks to a partnership with the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP), the MSIT-PE program will be offering on-campus IAPP Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP) certification exams to students in its program. The exams will be offered free of charge to those students who become IAPP student members. Scholarship opportunities are available for outstanding MSIT Privacy Engineering students!

Many MLT grads continue on to Ph.D. programs at CMU and other top institutions, while others pursue careers at companies emphasizing research and rapid innovation. The MLT program lasts two years (24 months), and students must complete two summers of research. Students should usually expect to graduate in August of their second year.MLT students take 120 or more course units (about 10 courses), at least 72 of which are LTI courses, and 24 of which are School of Computer Science (SCS) courses. Most of these are 12-unit courses, although lab courses are typically 6 units. Our courses generally assume knowledge of programming and data structures. The remaining units may also be taken from the LTI, or with approval from the faculty advisor, any other senior- or graduate-level course offered at CMU or Pitt.Directed research is another integral part of the MLT program; MLT students carry out directed research during their studies, with guidance from their faculty advisors.Students may also choose to complete an optional MLT thesis.

The extraordinary spread of computers and online data is changing forever the way that important decisions are made in many organizations. Hospitals now analyze online medical records to decide which treatments to apply to future patients. Banks analyze past financial records to learn to spot future fraud, while factories analyze past operations to learn to produce higher quality goods. While a first generation of data mining algorithms has already been developed and is gaining widespread commercial use, we expect future advances to dramatically increase the role of data mining throughout society. Today's demand for data mining expertise far exceeds the supply, and this imbalance will become more severe over the coming decade. Unfortunately, current degree programs in traditional disciplines fail to provide the kind of curriculum needed to train tomorrow's leaders in this area. The problem is that data mining requires a rich, interdisciplinary education combining topics such as advanced machine learning algorithms, statistical principles that provide the foundations for these algorithms, database and data warehousing methods, complexity analysis, approaches to data visualization, privacy and security issues, and specific application areas such as business, marketing, and public policy. Carnegie Mellon University's Master's program in Machine Learning is designed to train students to become tomorrow's leaders in the rapidly growing area of data mining. This program will build on Carnegie Mellon's Machine Learning Department which has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of faculty and students across several academic departments, dedicated to producing the next generation of data mining methods. By exposing students to this combination of interdisciplinary coursework, hands-on applications, and cutting-edge research, we expect our graduates will be uniquely positioned to pioneer new data mining efforts, and to pursue top notch research on the next generation of data mining tools, algorithms, and systems. Course Requirements The curriculum for the ML Masters is built on a foundation of five core courses and three electives (plus the Data Analysis Project requirement). The ML curriculum joins courses with a Computer Science main theme and those with a Probability and Statistics main theme. These may be grouped, as follows: In CS, relevant sub-fields include: Databases; Machine Learning, Data Mining and algorithms applications in areas such as Robotics, Information Retrieval and AI. In Statistics (including Philosophy), the sub-fields include: Statistical modeling (e.g., hierarchical and times series); Bayes' Nets, Causation, and experimental design. The curriculum is based on core academic courses on Intermediate Statistics, Machine Learning, Statistical Machine Learning, Multimedia Databases, and Algorithms. These core courses together provide a foundation in machine learning, statistics, probability, and algorithms. 10-701 Introduction to Machine Learing or 10-715 Advanced Introduction to Machine Learning 10-702 Statistical Machine Learning 36-705 Intermediate Statistics 10-701 Introduction to Machine Learing or 10-715 Advanced Introduction to Machine Learning 10-702 Statistical Machine Learning 36-705 Intermediate Statistics Plus any two of the following courses: 10-708 Probabilistic Graphical Models 10-725 Convex Optimization 15-826 Multimedia Databases and Data Mining 15-750 Algorithms or 15-853 Algorithms in the Real World 10-708 Probabilistic Graphical Models 10-725 Convex Optimization 15-826 Multimedia Databases and Data Mining 15-750 Algorithms or 15-853 Algorithms in the Real World The three electives may be chosen, in consultation with the student's advisor,to meet the interdisciplinary distribution requirements. List of electives. For a full list of available courses consult with your Advisor. Double Counting Courses: Any course counted toward another master-level or bachelor-level degree may not be counted toward our Secondary Master in Machine Learning. If a course is counted toward your PhD degree it may also be counted in our Secondary Master in Machine Learning, so long as such double-counting is permitted by your PhD department. The Data Analysis Project requirement: The final requirement is for the student to demonstrate data mining skills in the context of a focused project. The Data Analysis Project may be carried out either at Carnegie Mellon or at a sponsoring corporate institution under the joint supervision of the sponsor and a ML faculty. It will be concluded by a written report (in lieu of a Masters Thesis) in which the student demonstrates an ability to approach data mining problems in a way that cuts across existing disciplinary boundaries. The requirement includes a presentation in the ML Journal Club and also the submission of a DAP Paper. Passing this requirement will be the judgment of the DAP committee. Student must form an official \"DAP committee\" of three faculty to evaluate the document. The committee will consist of the advisor, the Journal club instructor(s), and one other faculty member selected by the student. The third member is typically someone with an interest in the analysis of the data set, and does not have to be an expert in ML or part of the student's thesis committee.The student should form the committee as early as possible during the DAP research process, and inform Diane of who the members are. Two faculty from the committee are required to attend the presentation.

The program is appropriate for students with backgrounds in an engineering or science discipline and practical abilities in computer systems and software engineering. Classroom training is reinforced by an extensive supervised practicum designed to expose the students to research laboratory and industrial environments. They will thus acquire - and be expected to demonstrate - individual and group competence in the skills and practices that will be needed to support the entrepreneurial teams they will lead upon their return to their home countries. The two-year program is composed of two one-year phases. First year studies are at an international partner institution's campus via distance education materials produced by the Robotics Institute and delivered by the partner's faculty. Successful students transition to Carnegie Mellon's main campus to complete a second year of classes and an extensive practicum. Graduates are eligible to pursue additional practical training in the US before returning to their home countries. Preferably the additional training will be an internship with a company in the US that, afterwards, will employ the student at a division in his or her home country. The program's intention is for graduates to return home to entrepreneurial activities that will contribute to sustainable development there.  Tuition and Fees Tuition for the MS-RT Year-Two Program at CMU, Pittsburgh campus is $48,000.

The current program was approved to award the unique MS-RT degree. For simplicity in this discussion, students who completed the pilot program are sometime also identified as MS-RT graduates.
