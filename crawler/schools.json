The MHCI is a two-year master\u2019s program that spans 12 months. During the first semester, students learn core knowledge in programming, design, psychology and HCI methods. During the second and third semesters, the students can choose from diverse electives across the university while they participate in a substantial industry capstone project with an external client.\nAt the end of 12 months, our students go on to successful careers where they lead and collaborate in the design and implementation of effective, efficient, and desirable software and technical systems. They are poised to contribute to multidisciplinary teams that typically develop software, technical systems and interfaces. They are broadly knowledgeable about the techniques for building successful user interfaces, the design principles that make user interfaces visually clear and appealing, and the techniques for identifying needs for software, its success, and the people and organizations that will use their systems.\nSince 1994, our program has graduated more than 600 students. The in-depth interdisciplinary experiences here at Carnegie Mellon make our students the glue between design, development and management in many companies. The MHCI student is often hired to play one role, but quickly becomes an indispensable team player\u00a0\u2014 in many cases, a team leader for research, design and strategy in software, technical or consulting engagements.\nNicole Willis\nAssociate Director of MHCI\nHuman-Computer Interaction Institute\nCarnegie Mellon University\n300 S.

The integrated discipline of computational biology/bioinformatics represents the application of modern computer science, statistics, and mathematics to exploring biological and biomedical problems. The Department of Biological Sciences in the Mellon College of Science and the Computational Biology Department in the School of Computer Science combine their world-class strengths in computer science and biology with the strong tradition of interdisciplinary research at Carnegie Mellon into a unique training program in this emerging field.\nThe M.S. in Computational Biology program enrolls students who desire a more immediate career in industry or who wish to explore computational biology without committing to a doctoral program. It also draws returning professionals who seek to enhance their skills and practices in this new interdisciplinary field.\nCoursework consists of Foundation Courses, Background Courses, and Breadth & Depth Courses, as well as a number of electives in a wide array of disciplines such as computer science, machine learning, math, statistics, biology, chemistry, biomedical engineering, and information management. Students have the option of conducting in-depth research in addition to coursework, and are also encouraged to seek external internships after their first year. Students pursue this degree full-time and complete the program in 3-4 semesters.\nStudents who have completed the program have gone on to work in a wide range of industries as well as goverment and academic institutions. Recent graduates have been employed at companies and institutes such as the J. Craig Venter Institute, Life Technologies, Philips Research, and Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, to name a few. Other graduates have gone on to pursue Ph.D. degrees at a number of top universities around the world.\nStudent Spotlight: Sonia Chothani\n"}, {"url": "http://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/education/master/index.html", "dept": "Computer Science", "name": "Master of Science in Computer Science", "text": "Jump to navigation\n\nThe Computer Science Department offers three different master\u2019s options for students who have completed (or will complete) a bachelor\u2019s degree and want to extend their training in computer science. Our largest program is the M.S. in Computer Science, which allows students with undergraduate degrees in computer science or another technical field to work with their academic advisor to create their own course of study. We also offer a fifth-year master\u2019s program for current SCS undergraduates, and a 3-2 MBA program with CMU\u2019s Tepper School of Business.\nM.S. in Computer Science\nThe M.S. in Computer Science offers students with a bachelor's degree the opportunity to improve their training with advanced study in computer science.\u00a0 We cater to students with basic analytic skills and a strong aptitude for mathematics, programming, and logical reasoning.\u00a0 You don\u2019t need a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science specifically for the program, but a technical undergraduate background will set you up for success.\nOur program isn\u2019t based on a fixed set of courses. Instead, you\u2019ll construct your own course of study, in consultation with your advisor. The program consists entirely of coursework, and there is generally no research component.\nMost students will complete the program in three semesters, but if you\u2019re switching to computer science from another field, you may need an additional semester to fill gaps in your undergraduate training. The M.S. program is distinct from the Ph.D. program in computer science, and master's students will not usually continue into the Ph.D. program and will not receive preferential treatment if they apply.\nFifth Year Masters Program\nWe designed the Fifth Year Masters Program specifically for students receiving a B.S. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon. The program encourages our very brightest undergraduates to become involved with research that broadens their undergraduate experience. We also want to encourage a select group of students to continue to graduate school by providing them with an additional qualification and period of study beyond their undergraduate degree, resulting in a master\u2019s degree in computer science.\nThe program usually lasts 12 months, including one normal academic year and one summer. Students will start working on a research project during the summer after their senior year, and continue that project while taking classes during the academic year. Students can only start the Fifth Year Masters program after they have received their B.S. in computer science at CMU.\nStudents interested in applying to the Fifth Year Master\u2019s Program should do so by the middle of the fall semester of their senior year. Students are admitted based on strong evidence of research potential through close interaction with one or more faculty members \u2014 whether in projects, summer jobs or advanced classes. In addition to support from their faculty sponsor, each student should have strong support from other faculty members who believe that the student shows great promise for doing research.\nAccelerated MBA Program\nStudents interested in earning their bachelor\u2019s degree and MBA in five years may be interested in the Tepper School of Business\u2019s Accelerated MBA program. The program is administered by the Tepper Schoool, and more information is available here.\nUndergraduate Programs\nThe admissions process for each undergraduate major varies from program to program, but admissions for our main bachelor of science in computer science are handled through Carnegie Mellon's central Office of Undergraduate Admission. Learn more on our Undergraduate Admissions page.\nMaster's Programs\nThe Computer Science Department offers a main M.S. in Computer Science, and applications for that program are submitted online by mid-December for fall admission the following year. Other master's programs available to CSD students have their own admissions processes. Learn more about our admissions requirements and processes here.\nDoctoral Programs\nThe Ph.D. in CS program uses the School of Computer Science online application for admissions. Applications are due in December for admittance the following fall. Students cannot begin in the spring.

It is only during manufacturing or after a deal has been consummated that physical goods must be moved.As a result, most improvements in business result from advances in information technology, a field that is changing so rapidly it is difficult even for professionals to keep up with it. It is always a question how to teach a subject that is constantly in flux.There is risk that the technical content will be obsolete by the end of the degree program, or shortly after its completion.Our philosophy is that professionals must learn not technology alone, but how to keep up with technology.An equally important precept of our program is that skills cannot be taught, but must be learned through practice.We follow these principles through a unique program specifically designed to produce eBusiness professionals. We do not offer traditional classes.While students are allowed to take a limited number of traditional elective courses in other departments, the MSIT eBusiness program does not offer courses of its own.We believe that the meta-skills required for success in the workplace, such as team building, time management, interpreting confusing or ambiguous assignments, professional writing and public speaking, can be acquired only through direct and extensive practice.Toward that end, the program consists first of 16 realistic eBusiness tasks that are so extensive they must be completed by teams.Accordingly, the students are initially divided into teams of five people who receive new tasks to perform every 2-3 weeks for 10 months. The students must produce professional deliverables, such as reports, technology analyses, business plans and system designs.Because the teams operate independently with minimal guidance, the students must learn to organize themselves, divide workload, become familiar with relevant technologies, and separate important from irrelevant reference material to complete the assigned work on schedule.Guiding the students through the program are three full-time Program Faculty, who work along with 11 other faculty members to ensure that everyone acquires the skills expected of our graduates. Many of our graduates aspire to be consultants, and consulting preparation is sound training for almost any information technology job.Therefore, to make the degree program as realistic as possible, all students become employees of a hypothetical company, ebConsultants LLP, for the 12-month duration of the program.As staff consultants, the students rotate through four assignments in each of the companys practices: Health Care, Financial, Retail and Logistics.Team composition changes at each transition, so the students have a chance to exercise their organizational skills at different times.To compress 10 months into a single sentence, the most crucial skill the students acquire is learning how to teach themselves. That skill is valuable for a lifetime and outlasts any conceivable shift in technology. The Practicum After the students have completed 16 eBusiness team tasks, they are already highly skilled consultants.To prove that to themselves and the faculty, the students are once again divided into teams to work on real problems of current interest furnished by actual industrial sponsors.These Practicum problems are tackled by teams of six students with the aid of two faculty advisors. The projects usually involve the design and implementation of an eBusiness system at least at the level of a prototype.This involves a requirements analysis, selection of a technology and consideration of alternative designs.The students must negotiate the scope of the project, achieve agreement on deliverables, and secure sponsor approval of interim deliverables.The last half of the Practicum is occupied with implementation, completion of written work product and refining presentations. The Practicum differs from the first 16 tasks in that it is much longer (9-10 weeks) and each team works on a different project.The main grading criterion is sponsor satisfaction, which is the ultimate goal of a consulting company.The sponsor has presented a problem  nothing less than an effective solution is acceptable. In addition to producing deliverables and providing an extensive briefing to the sponsor, each team makes a public presentation explaining the problem and its recommended solution, including a demonstration of a required software artifact.As an extra incentive, the presentations are judged by an independent panel of outside eBusiness experts.Each team is judged on the effectiveness of their solution and the quality of their presentation.The winning team receives a cash prize of $10,000. The Practicum provides an opportunity for students to work closely with a company on a problem of genuine importance.The company, in turn, has a chance to observe the students in a work situation, which may lead to a subsequent employment offer. Past Practicum sponsors have included Alcoa, American Eagle Outfitters, Johnson & Johnson, PNCBank, the Port of Pittsburgh and Wells Fargo.The results of several projects have been developed by sponsors into working eBusiness systems. Many students consider the Practicum to be the most useful and rewarding university experience of their lives. By the time they have completed this 17th and capstone project, the students are ready to face any challenge in the eBusiness sector. Diversity Our program is highly diverse and multicultural.The class of 2012 consists of 50 students from 14 different countries.The team nature of the program affords an unparalleled opportunity for students to work closely with others from a range of cultures and nationalities.We are particularly proud that 47% of our students are women. The School of Computer Science and Carnegie Mellon in general provide a hospitable environment for a multinational student body. Recruiting Recipients of professional degrees expect to secure suitable jobs after graduation.Toward that end, our program employs a full-time recruiter, Tami Radomski, to assist students in preparing resumes, learning interviewing skills, obtaining interviews and negotiating job offers.Students meet individually with Tami throughout the year to map out a personalized strategy for obtaining high-quality positions. Our graduates have gone on to become managers, programmers, business analysts and consultants, often in Silicon Valley.Some students have started companies of their own.

MSIT in Privacy Engineering The Master of Science in Information TechnologyPrivacy Engineering (MSIT-PE) degree is a one-year program designed for computer scientists and engineers who wish to pursue careers as privacy engineers or technical privacy managers. Designed in close collaboration with industry and government, this program is intended for students who aspire to play a critical role in building privacy into future products, services, and processes. This first-of-its kind program responds to the rapidly growing need for technical privacy expertise. As organizations develop new products, services, infrastructures and business processes that facilitate the collection and management of an ever-wider range of customer data, they are discovering that privacy issues need to be addressed from the very beginning of the design process. Over the past several years, both industry and government organizations have created positions for people responsible for ensuring that privacy is an integral part of the design process. These people are brought in as in-house consultants who work as part of multi-disciplinary teams. They have to understand technology and be able to integrate perspectives that span product design, software development, cyber security, human computer interaction, as well as business and legal considerations. Today organizations are already reporting a significant shortage of people who are adequately trained to play this increasingly crucial role, while demand is continuing to increase. The 12-month MSIT in Privacy Engineering program combines the best and most successful elements gleaned from Carnegie Mellon Universitys long and distinguished history of professional masters programs. Offered jointly by the School of Computer Science and College of Engineering, the program includes two semesters of courses taught by leading academic privacy and security experts. The program concludes with a summer-long learning-by-doing, capstone project, where students will be brought in as privacy consultants to work on client projects. Students who complete this program will be well prepared for jobs as privacy engineers and technical privacy managers. Starting in the 2013-2014 academic year, thanks to a partnership with the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP), the MSIT-PE program will be offering on-campus IAPP Certified Information Privacy Professional (CIPP) certification exams to students in its program. The exams will be offered free of charge to those students who become IAPP student members. Scholarship opportunities are available for outstanding MSIT Privacy Engineering students!

Many MLT grads continue on to Ph.D. programs at CMU and other top institutions, while others pursue careers at companies emphasizing research and rapid innovation. The MLT program lasts two years (24 months), and students must complete two summers of research. Students should usually expect to graduate in August of their second year.MLT students take 120 or more course units (about 10 courses), at least 72 of which are LTI courses, and 24 of which are School of Computer Science (SCS) courses. Most of these are 12-unit courses, although lab courses are typically 6 units. Our courses generally assume knowledge of programming and data structures. The remaining units may also be taken from the LTI, or with approval from the faculty advisor, any other senior- or graduate-level course offered at CMU or Pitt.Directed research is another integral part of the MLT program; MLT students carry out directed research during their studies, with guidance from their faculty advisors.Students may also choose to complete an optional MLT thesis.

The extraordinary spread of computers and online data is changing forever the way that important decisions are made in many organizations. Hospitals now analyze online medical records to decide which treatments to apply to future patients. Banks analyze past financial records to learn to spot future fraud, while factories analyze past operations to learn to produce higher quality goods. While a first generation of data mining algorithms has already been developed and is gaining widespread commercial use, we expect future advances to dramatically increase the role of data mining throughout society. Today's demand for data mining expertise far exceeds the supply, and this imbalance will become more severe over the coming decade. Unfortunately, current degree programs in traditional disciplines fail to provide the kind of curriculum needed to train tomorrow's leaders in this area. The problem is that data mining requires a rich, interdisciplinary education combining topics such as advanced machine learning algorithms, statistical principles that provide the foundations for these algorithms, database and data warehousing methods, complexity analysis, approaches to data visualization, privacy and security issues, and specific application areas such as business, marketing, and public policy. Carnegie Mellon University's Master's program in Machine Learning is designed to train students to become tomorrow's leaders in the rapidly growing area of data mining. This program will build on Carnegie Mellon's Machine Learning Department which has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of faculty and students across several academic departments, dedicated to producing the next generation of data mining methods. By exposing students to this combination of interdisciplinary coursework, hands-on applications, and cutting-edge research, we expect our graduates will be uniquely positioned to pioneer new data mining efforts, and to pursue top notch research on the next generation of data mining tools, algorithms, and systems. Course Requirements The curriculum for the ML Masters is built on a foundation of five core courses and three electives (plus the Data Analysis Project requirement). The ML curriculum joins courses with a Computer Science main theme and those with a Probability and Statistics main theme. These may be grouped, as follows: In CS, relevant sub-fields include: Databases; Machine Learning, Data Mining and algorithms applications in areas such as Robotics, Information Retrieval and AI. In Statistics (including Philosophy), the sub-fields include: Statistical modeling (e.g., hierarchical and times series); Bayes' Nets, Causation, and experimental design. The curriculum is based on core academic courses on Intermediate Statistics, Machine Learning, Statistical Machine Learning, Multimedia Databases, and Algorithms. These core courses together provide a foundation in machine learning, statistics, probability, and algorithms. 10-701 Introduction to Machine Learing or 10-715 Advanced Introduction to Machine Learning 10-702 Statistical Machine Learning 36-705 Intermediate Statistics 10-701 Introduction to Machine Learing or 10-715 Advanced Introduction to Machine Learning 10-702 Statistical Machine Learning 36-705 Intermediate Statistics Plus any two of the following courses: 10-708 Probabilistic Graphical Models 10-725 Convex Optimization 15-826 Multimedia Databases and Data Mining 15-750 Algorithms or 15-853 Algorithms in the Real World 10-708 Probabilistic Graphical Models 10-725 Convex Optimization 15-826 Multimedia Databases and Data Mining 15-750 Algorithms or 15-853 Algorithms in the Real World The three electives may be chosen, in consultation with the student's advisor,to meet the interdisciplinary distribution requirements. List of electives. For a full list of available courses consult with your Advisor. Double Counting Courses: Any course counted toward another master-level or bachelor-level degree may not be counted toward our Secondary Master in Machine Learning. If a course is counted toward your PhD degree it may also be counted in our Secondary Master in Machine Learning, so long as such double-counting is permitted by your PhD department. The Data Analysis Project requirement: The final requirement is for the student to demonstrate data mining skills in the context of a focused project. The Data Analysis Project may be carried out either at Carnegie Mellon or at a sponsoring corporate institution under the joint supervision of the sponsor and a ML faculty. It will be concluded by a written report (in lieu of a Masters Thesis) in which the student demonstrates an ability to approach data mining problems in a way that cuts across existing disciplinary boundaries. The requirement includes a presentation in the ML Journal Club and also the submission of a DAP Paper. Passing this requirement will be the judgment of the DAP committee. Student must form an official \"DAP committee\" of three faculty to evaluate the document. The committee will consist of the advisor, the Journal club instructor(s), and one other faculty member selected by the student. The third member is typically someone with an interest in the analysis of the data set, and does not have to be an expert in ML or part of the student's thesis committee.The student should form the committee as early as possible during the DAP research process, and inform Diane of who the members are. Two faculty from the committee are required to attend the presentation.

The program is appropriate for students with backgrounds in an engineering or science discipline and practical abilities in computer systems and software engineering. Classroom training is reinforced by an extensive supervised practicum designed to expose the students to research laboratory and industrial environments. They will thus acquire - and be expected to demonstrate - individual and group competence in the skills and practices that will be needed to support the entrepreneurial teams they will lead upon their return to their home countries. The two-year program is composed of two one-year phases. First year studies are at an international partner institution's campus via distance education materials produced by the Robotics Institute and delivered by the partner's faculty. Successful students transition to Carnegie Mellon's main campus to complete a second year of classes and an extensive practicum. Graduates are eligible to pursue additional practical training in the US before returning to their home countries. Preferably the additional training will be an internship with a company in the US that, afterwards, will employ the student at a division in his or her home country. The program's intention is for graduates to return home to entrepreneurial activities that will contribute to sustainable development there.  Tuition and Fees Tuition for the MS-RT Year-Two Program at CMU, Pittsburgh campus is $48,000. Additional details about graduate student fees and estimated cost of living in Pittsburgh can be found at: www.cmu.edu/hub Additional information How To Apply Curriculum Graduate Student Life Handbook How To Apply Curriculum Graduate Student Life Handbook For more information, contact Rachel Burcin (rachel@cmu.edu, (412) 268-4272).  1Historical Note: During the pilot study version of this program that operated between 2003 and 2007 some graduates received MS-IT degrees and some received MS-IT RT degrees. The current program was approved to award the unique MS-RT degree. For simplicity in this discussion, students who completed the pilot program are sometime also identified as MS-RT graduates.

First, it guarantees that you have a broad grounding in computer science as a discipline. Second, it certifies that you have studied a particular area in detail and thus have additional depth in a particular specialty. Both components are important to the Master's program, and it is not possible to secure a Stanford MSCS degree that does not meet both requirements. The central requirement for the MSCS degree is completion of at least 45 units that represent an approved academic plan. The concrete representation of that academic plan is your program sheet, which lists the courses you intend to use to satisfy the 45-unit requirement. Breadth Requirement Students are asked to demonstrate breadth by taking courses in three general areas: Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations Computer Systems AI and Applications Mathematical and Theoretical Foundations Computer Systems AI and Applications Typically, each area is organized as a small set of required courses and a larger set from which you can choose particular courses that fit best with your overall program. To satisfy the breadth requirement, you must demonstrate that you have taken each of the required courses, along with an appropriate subset of the higher-level breadth courses that meet the requirements for each area. It is important to understand that only coursework can be used to satisfy the breadth requirement. Additionally, you may not count more than 21 units from the set of courses that comprise the program prerequisites (courses numbered between CS100 and CS109) and the courses listed under the breadth requirement category. If you need to take more courses in these categories, your program will have to include more than 45 total units. Sometime early in your first quarter - preferably in the first week or two - you should schedule a meeting with your academic advisor and go over your breadth requirements. Contact the department of Computer Science for detailed information on the Breadth Requirement by sending email to: admissions@cs.stanford.edu Seminars The MSCS program requires you to complete at least one 500-level CS seminar (or EE380 or EE385A) so that you have some exposure to the research activity of the department. Although they may take more, students may only count a maximum of three units of seminars (or other 1-2 unit courses) toward the MSCS degree. Depth Requirement In addition to the breadth requirement, the Stanford MSCS program requires that all students take at least 21 units in a specific area of specialization. Most students complete one of the ten department approved specializations, but may also petition the MSCS committee to approve a specialization of their own design. The ten approved specializations are: Artificial Intelligence Biocomputation Computer and Network Security Database Systems Human-Computer Interaction Numerical Analysis/Scientific Computation Real-World Computing Software Theory Systems Theoretical Computer Science Artificial Intelligence Biocomputation Computer and Network Security Database Systems Human-Computer Interaction Numerical Analysis/Scientific Computation Real-World Computing Software Theory Systems Theoretical Computer Science In most cases, a specialization consists of a set of required courses, a larger set of courses out of which you must select some subset, and a larger set from which you select additional courses to fill out the 21-unit requirement. More detailed information about breadth requirements and specialization areas can be found at: CS degree planning tool. Questions about admission to the graduate program in Computer Science should be directed to: admissions@cs.stanford.edu Electives Elective courses are really up to the student to select, even though the entire program must be approved by their advisor. In general, courses in computer science numbered at the 100-level or above (with the exception of CS196, 197, and 198) are suitable as electives. Courses in related departments, such as Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Statistics, numbered at the 100-level or above and technical in nature are also likely to be approved. On the other hand, courses that are completely unrelated to computer science would not normally be appropriate as electives. Additional Requirements Minimum GPA requirement: In order to receive an MSCS degree, the student's GPA in the courses they submit on their program sheet must be at least 3.0, which corresponds to a B in Stanford's grading scale. Note that students need not get a B in every course. All the requirement states is that the overall GPA, which is simply the average of the numeric grade weighted by the number of units in each course, must be at least a 3.0. Note, however, that the GPA is computed only for the courses students submit on their program sheet. If a student does poorly in several courses, it may be wise for them to eliminate those courses from their program sheet and substitute other courses in which they have done better. Substitutions may require the student to take more than 45 units, but it is important to know that a single disastrous grade will not necessarily doom their entire program. Letter-grade requirement: This requirement is mostly self-explanatory but nonetheless deserves emphasis. At least 36 of the required 45 units, including all of the depth units submitted for specialization, must be taken for a letter grade. Note that seminar courses, which must be taken on an S/NC basis, are not letter-graded courses. The remaining 9 units may be taken on a credit/no credit basis if the student so chooses. Tuition For course tuition and fees, please click Tuition & Fees. Time Commitment Most part-time students take an average of 3 to5 years to complete the 45-unit requirement. You must complete a Master's degree within 5 years of starting the program. Admissions Detailed information about the graduate degree program and admission process can be found on the Computer Science Department web site: Computer Science Graduate Program. For assistance while in the application process, please contact the Computer Science Student Services Office using the following email address: admissions@cs.stanford.edu Expected Background The MSCS program assumes that all entering students have acquired the foundations of computer science at the level of an undergrad minor. At Stanford, these foundations are represented by the following courses, which are considered as the standard prerequisites for the program: CS103 (Logic, Automata and Complexity) CS109 or STAT116 or CME106 or MS&E220(Probability) CS161 (Algorithmic Analysis) CS107 (Computer Organization and Systems) CS110 (Principles of Computer Systems) CS103 (Logic, Automata and Complexity) CS109 or STAT116 or CME106 or MS&E220(Probability) CS161 (Algorithmic Analysis) CS107 (Computer Organization and Systems) CS110 (Principles of Computer Systems) If you have taken these courses - either at Stanford or elsewhere - you have the necessary background to begin studying atthe MSCS level. Program Proposal Students must file their initial program sheet before the end of your first registered quarter as a MSCS student. Filing the program sheet, however, does not lock you into taking exactly the set of courses you originally propose. If you need to change your plan of study, you must simply renegotiate the contract, which means filing a new program sheet that represents your updated course of study. You must get your advisor's signature on the revised plan but need not get new signatures for individual courses that were approved on a previously filed program. The important thing to remember is that, before you will be cleared for graduation, you must have a program sheet on file that matches the courses that you in fact completed. If you decide to change your course of study, you should get a new program sheet signed as soon as possible to ensure that the changes are in fact approved.

Program Description Increasingly a Master's degree is considered an essential beginning for a long-term career in Electrical Engineering and in Computer Science. At minimum, a Master's allows a deeper technical specialization, giving you both a head start in your chosen career as well as a long-term advantage as you find it easier to track new developments and change direction in your career as opportunities arise. You will find many universities, including some very fine ones that offer a purely technical Master's degree option. However, none of them is comparable to Berkeley's Master of Engineering, which goes beyond the technical specialization and offers you courses in engineering leadership and a team-oriented capstone project experience that allows you to practice, under careful mentorship and guidance, the technical and non-technical skills that you learn in the classroom. Our Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (M.Eng. in EECS) gives you the opportunity to take our world-class graduate courses on scientific and technical topics, organized by technical concentrations that match your interest. However, the reality is that success in an engineering career requires skills that transcend the scientific and technical. In a modern engineering development organization, you almost always have to accomplish goals through teamwork, and you have to be able to communicate your ideas and influence people (colleagues, investors, customers) through effective oral and written communication. Even as you tackle difficult technical challenges, you have to consider the match between your ideas and the needs of eventual users, how your choices give your organization competitive advantage, and how to protect your investments with intellectual property. Increasingly you have to develop an idea in a multi-disciplinary environment, consider complex systems issues as well as detailed technical issues, and position yourself in an ecosystem of suppliers, outsourcing resources, and complementary products and strategic relationships. Our Masters of Engineering curriculum has anticipated all this, and prepares you in advance for these real-world challenges that you will encounter, including both classroom study and project experience in the practice of these skills. Our Master of Engineering degree is full-time, and takes one academic year (Fall and Spring, but not Summer) to complete. You join a cross-disciplinary cohort including students from four Departments in the College of Engineering. Classes are kept small to encourage interaction with your student cohort, your professors and your industry collaborators. These networks are reinforced through career advising and placement, access to alumni and industry connections and other services. All classes are taught on the Berkeley campus by top Berkeley Engineering faculty. Upon completion, you earn the Master of Engineering degree in EECS, reflecting an integrated understanding of technology, practice, and leadership. Finally, need we mention that this is Berkeley, one of the top EECS and Engineering programs in the world? You will gain exposure to a world-class faculty, as well as an unparalleled student body within EECS and other engineering disciplines. Consider joining us for an academic year, and partake in the academic experience of a lifetime. With a relatively modest investment of time and money, you will be better prepared for a satisfying and lasting career in engineering design, development, and management. Comparing Programs EECS offers several Master degrees for planning a career in industry: the professional Masters of Engineering, and the online MAS-IC. In addition, a 5th year M.S. degree is open for Berkeley undergraduates only. Graduate degrees focusing on research are described under the MS/PhD and PhD degrees. Master of Engineering The MEng program is a one year professional Master's degree. The program focuses on developing essential leadership skills while deepening the technical foundation. The MEng program is specifically streamlined for students looking to enter into industry after graduation. Master of Advanced Study in Integrated Circuits MAS-IC is an online program for working professionals wishing to gain in-depth expertise in the field of Integrated Circuits. The degree typically takes two years of part-time study to complete. Joint Bachelors/Masters Program (5th Year MS) This program is for Berkeley EECS/L&S CS undergraduates only and requires a continued research project with an EECS faculty member. Master of Science (MS, MS/PhD, PhD) The Master of Science (MS) program is a very small research program for exceptional applicants with research experience. The MS leads to a PhD or career in industrial R&D. Areas of Concentration The EECS department offers concentrations in both Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The 2015-2016 degree program offers the following concentrations. It is important to note that choosing one of these areas does not prevent you from taking courses in other areas. Data Science and Systems: Prepares you for engineering careers in data-centric industries requiring understanding of data management fundamentals as well as the latest technologies and techniques for the collection, storage, and analysis of information. Physical Electronics and Integrated Circuits:Prepares you for engineering careers in industries needing an understanding of state-of-the-art analog and digital integrated circuits including RF communication circuits, A/D converters, sensor interfaces and design techniques used in today's most advanced integrated circuits. Robotics and Embedded Software: Prepares you for engineering careers in industries applying robotics and embedded software to markets for manufacturing, automation, process control, automotive, aerospace, medical instruments, entertainment and other fields. Signal Processing and Communications: Prepares you for engineering careers in industries applying signal processing or communications. Markets include wireless communication, computer networking, entertainment, video processing, biomedical, etc. Visual Computing and Computer Graphics: Prepares you for engineering careers in industries applying advanced computer graphics, computer-aided design, and human-computer interaction methods to markets for education and training, entertainment, commerce, design and manufacturing, electronic journalism and similar fields. Curriculum There are three distinct elements to our Master of Engineering curriculum.

Areas of research in the field include algorithms, architecture, artificial intelligence, computer vision, computational biology, concurrency and distributed computing, database systems, machine learning, machine vision, natural language processing, networks, numerical analysis, programming environments, programming languages and methodology, robotics, and theory of computation.Research facilities:The department makes use of a mix of computing platforms, with about three-quarters of our research and instructional computing taking place on Microsoft's Windows operating systems and Intel Architecture processors and the remaining quarter on Red Hat Linux desktop and Red Hat Linux and Sun Solaris back-end servers. The department has more than1,200 computers ranging from desktops to high-end parallel processing servers, more than 15 terabytes of online disk storage, and a backbone network based on switched Gigabit Ethernet.In addition to the resources directly owned and operated by the department, computer science students and researchers have access to a number of university facilities. The university provides extensive campus-wide networking, including RedRover, an 802.11b wireless campus network. National and international access is provided by three OC3 connections to the global Internet. High-speed community access is available through Time-Warner's RoadRunner cable modem system and several DSL providers. Finally, through the Cornell Theory Center and the Program in Computer Graphics, computer science researchers have access to a wide range of advanced parallel processing and supercomputer systems, as well as advanced graphics and visualization systems.

Applicants must have a proven record of excellence as an undergraduate grader/TA in a computer science course. Experience as an undergraduate researcher is highly recommended. The Application Applications are due January 1 for a Fall Semester start. An application consists of (a) transcripts of all college-level work, (b) three letters of recommendation including at least one that addresses expository skills and the ability to work in a classroom setting, and (c) an essay that explains how the degree program and the anticipated thesis area resonates with career plans. All applicants (except current Cornell undergraduates) are required to take the GRE general test. Non-native English speakers are required to take the TOEFL. Scores on the Writing, Listening, and Reading components must be 24 or higher and 28 or higher for the Speaking component. The Research Option Although MS students are normally supported by teaching assistantships provided by the department, the Research Option makes it possible to admit students with less background or interest in teaching, who are then supported by research assistantships provided by sponsored research projects. The source of funding must be identified in advance, and students who wish to be supported in this fashion must have a recommendation letter from the sponsoring faculty member.

These degree programs are sufficiently flexible to adapt to individual plans of study and research. The Department of Computer Science accepts both beginning and advanced graduate students for study and research leading to the degree of Master of Science in Engineering (M.S.E.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.). These degree programs are sufficiently flexible to adapt to individual plans of study and research. Applying Applicants are required to select a subplan when applying. Ph.D. Program Description: The doctoral program in computer science combines course work and participation in original research. Most students enter the program with an undergraduate degree in computer science, mathematics, or a related discipline. Some entering students may have a masters degree, but that is not necessary for success in the program. Every admitted Ph.D. student is given financial support in the form of a first-year fellowship. In addition, all admitted Ph.D. students are automatically considered for the prestigious Wu and Upton Fellowships. Courses: In preparation for the general examination, the doctoral candidate, in consultation with a faculty adviser, develops an integrated program of study in one of the departmental areas of research. Such preparation usually requires two academic years for students entering with a bachelors degree, and one year for students entering with a masters. All students must fulfill the programming and competency requirements by the end of the second year, demonstrating minimum competence in four main areas of computer science: computer systems, software systems, intelligent computing, and theory. Programming This requirement can be satisfied in either of two ways - through successful completion of a project that involves substantial programming (done under faculty supervision) or by taking a course and receiving a satisfactory grade (normally B+ or higher). Acceptable courses are COS 318, 320, 425, 426, 429, 461, 526, 561, or any approved graduate course. Taking only the course exam does not give programming credit. This requirement must be completed by the end of the fourth year. Breadth A total of 6 courses will be required. The first three constitute the core breadth requirement. You must take one course from each group -- AI, Systems, and Theory -- from the courses listed below. The remaining three courses can be any 400- or 500-level course from any department in the University, with approval required from your academic advisor and the Director of Graduate Studies for courses outside of Computer Science. All courses must be taken for a grade. A grade of A- or higher will normally be expected. However, all grades will be reviewed by the faculty and a lower grade may be acceptable based on your total record. Individual research areas may set additional requirements for their students; they may specify certain courses to be taken or may require that courses in excess of the departmental requirement be taken. Students are expected to complete the breadth requirement by the end of the second year. In special circumstances, a student's adviser may request an additional year, provided that four of the six courses have been completed. The programming requirement must be completed by the end of the second year. Individual research areas may set additional course requirements for their students; they may specify certain courses to be taken or may require that courses in excess of the departmental requirement be taken.

The oral tests the student's knowledge in a number of topics relevant to the student's research area. These topics are specified beforehand by an examining committee in consultation with the student. The seminar is open to the public, and at least three computer science faculty members must attend. Two are invited by the student; the other is selected by the director of graduate studies. The examining committee and the student agree upon a reading list for the exam. This document is to be made available to anyone present in the oral examination, and only questions pertaining to either the material described in the document or presented during the research seminar can be asked during the oral. Original research results do not have to be presented, but problems whose solution may lead to a thesis should be discussed. In many cases, the students thesis is in the same area as the research seminar, but this is not required.

In many cases, the students thesis is in the same area as the research seminar, but this is not required. Qualifying for the M.A.: The Master of Arts (M.A.) degree is normally an incidental degree on the way to full Ph.D. candidacy and is earned after a student successfully completes the programming competency and the three basic area competencies, and presents an acceptable research seminar. Teaching: Teaching experience is considered to be a significant part of graduate education. All Ph.D. candidates are therefore required to assist with course instruction for the equivalent of two terms. Post-Generals Requirement(s): Preliminary Public Defense In preparation for the final public oral examination, the candidate participates in a preliminary public oral examination to be held at least six months prior to the expected completion date. It covers results to-date and planned research, and serves as a preliminary critique of the proposed dissertation. It is attended by the adviser, two dissertation readers, and two faculty members who serve on the final public oral examination committee, and it is open to the public. Dissertation and FPO: The Ph.D is awarded after the acceptance of the dissertation and completion of the final public oral. M.S.E. Program Description: The master's degree programat Princeton is a two-year, full-time program. All admitted students will initially be enrolled in the Master of Science in Engineering (M.S.E.), thesis-required track. In the spring of year 1, as part of readmission, all students will be given the option to switch to the Master of Engineering (M.Eng.), non-thesis track. Students opting to remain on the M.S.E. track must have a confirmed research adviser and should also have a preliminary thesis proposal. Switching tracks will be permitted through January of year 2. Funding is normally in the form of teaching assistantships covering the four semesters of the program. Non-native English speakers must have a TOEFL speak score of 28 or better to be considered for a teaching assistantship. Applicants who do not meet this requirement may opt to apply as self-funded students. Summer funding for M.S.E. candidates in the form of a research assistantship may be offered at the adviser's discretion. Students wishing to continue on for a Ph.D. should apply through the normal application process during the fall of their second year of study. Princeton undergraduate students who wish to apply to the master's program must do so through the regular admission process, and by the December 15 deadline. Admission is competitive. You will need to submit (1) a one-page personal statement describing your preparation to date and why you are interested in the master's program; and (2) an unofficial copy of your transcript. In addition, you must have two letters of recommendation from COS professors emailed directly to the graduate coordinator. Once these materials have been received, the director of graduate studies will perform an informal review and provide feedback about whether admission into the master's program is \"likely,\" \"unlikely,\" or \"possible.\" This feedback is not binding -- it is meant only to help planning for senior year. Courses: All coursework must be taken for a grade. A minimum of 4 courses must be taken in year 1. If, due to scheduling conflicts, this is not possible, approval by the director of graduate studies is required. In no event will time to degree be extended beyond two years. Candidates choose a subarea of computer science on which to focus by taking appropriate courses, and writing a thesis under the direction of an adviser. Course requirements are fulfilled by taking six courses for a grade, at least three of which must be 500-level courses. The other eligible courses are 318, 320, 326, 375, or any 400-level course. Relevant courses from outside the department may be taken with adviser's consent. Candidates must maintain a B average, with no more than one C allowed. In order to be readmitted for a second year, candidates must have a confirmed thesis adviser and preliminary thesis proposal by the end of the first year. Thesis: Candidates must prepare and submit an original thesis as well as present a public seminar on the research. The thesis will be reviewed and graded by the students adviser plus one additional reader from the Princeton faculty. If the reader is from outside the Department ofComputer Science, approval by the director of graduate studies is required. The public seminar is an ungraded 20-minute talk, followed by a 10-minute question session, given in the spring of year 2. This will allow the students adviser and reader to give preliminary feedback prior to submission of the final thesis. The written thesis should be a research paper of \"scholarly quality\" -- making a novel contribution to scholarship in the field. The thesis should motivate the chosen research problem, evaluate the proposed solution (e.g., via analysis, measurement, simulation, or prototype implementation), and compare the approach to the related work in the field. While there is no specific length requirement, a reasonable target is a typical conference paper (e.g., 10-15 pages in two-column format or 20-40 pages in single-column, double-spaced format). Due date will be Dean's Date in the spring term of year 2. After being graded, four copies of the final version must be submitted to the department: two bound copies, following the formatting guidelines from Mudd Library, one unbound hard-copy, and the fourth as a .pdf file. Please note: Candidates electing to switch to the M.Eng degree track must complete a total of eight courses over two years, and are not required to submit a thesis. Three of the eight must be 500-level, and the additional courses may be chosen from 318, 320, 326, 375, or any 400-level course. Relevant courses from outside the department may be taken with adviser's consent. All courses must be taken for a grade. Candidates must maintain a B average, with no more than one C allowed. Princeton Option For Princeton undergraduates interested in continuing at Princeton for a master's degree: A degree track has been established that allows current Princeton students pursuing a masters degree with the computer science department to use credits from two courses taken as undergraduates that weretaken beyond the requirements of the computer science department for the bachelor's degree. Those two must be upper-level COS courses that fulfill requirements of the masters degree. Transferrable courses must be upper-level COS courses taken in excess of undergraduate degree requirements.

COS 513 Foundations of Probabilistic Modeling Probabilistic modeling is a mainstay in data analysis, providing essential tools for complex analyses of the vast amounts of data that have become available in modern scientific research. In this course, we study probabilistic graphical models, a unifying formalism for describing and extending many previous methods from statistics and engineering; the mathematical foundations of this field; and the methods underlying the current state of the art. We study these models through careful reading of current papers and a thorough real data analysis project. Instructor(s): Barbara Engelhardt COS 518 Advanced Computer Systems COS-518 is a graduate course in computer systems. Its goals are: (1) To understand the core concepts of computer systems, rather than particular implementation details.

Computational Science and Engineering Georgia Techs interdisciplinary Masters degree in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) is devoted to the creation, study, and application of computer-based models of natural and engineered systems. CSE MS students are exceptionally prepared for careers in industry, government, and academia. The program is offered with the option to take portions, or in some instances, all of the coursework off-campus viaGeorgia Tech Professional Education. The curriculum has been structured to impart students with solid CSE foundational knowledge and skills, and includes technical specialization courses that enhance a student's domain expertise. Advanced elective courses will enable students to specialize in a domain and technical expertise focusing on their particular interests. The optional thesis portion of the program requires completion of an interdisciplinary research project. Admissions Requirements Interested in applying for the CSE MS program? Submit an application through Georgia Tech admissions and be sure to designate a home unit. Apply Now! Keep in mind: Most students entering the CSE graduate degree programs will have obtained a bachelors degree in a technical field, e.g., computer science, mathematics, or a science or engineering discipline. Students should have taken undergraduate calculus courses. Some CSE courses will require additional coursework in topics such as linear algebra or differential equations. A working knowledge of probability and statistics will also be helpful in some core courses and specializations. Students should have taken at least one course, but preferably two and have developed a proficiency in programming in a high level language such as C, FORTRAN or Java. Students deficient in one or more of these areas may still gain admission, but should expect to take some additional coursework.

Computational Science and Engineering Master's degree is a joint program between the Colleges of Computing, Sciences and Engineering. The CSE Master's degree program includes an option to take most coursesthroughGeorgia Tech Professional Education. Students do not need to physically reside on the Atlanta campus while taking coursework through Professional Education. Students must register as an online student in semesters when taking one or more courses, and all courses taken during those semesters should be courses through Professional Education. In other words, one cannot take some courses on campus and others through Professional Education during the same semester. Students should carefully evaluate the course offerings provided through Georgia Tech Professional Education before applying as an online student. While most courses with a CSE course designation are offered through Professional Education, many specialization courses are only offered on campus. The CSE program handbook includes information concerning specific specialization courses that have been offered through Professional Education in the past (see the appendices in the handbook listing specialization courses).

The Computer Science option gives students a strong grounding in the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of computing, provides an introduction to cutting-edge research in a variety of subfields of Computer Science, and prepares them to apply computational thinking to a diversity of applications in Computer Science and beyond. Our students and faculty strive to: understand information and computation as intrinsic components of a broad array of natural and engineered systems tackle challenging and fundamental problems with the potential for long-term and real-world impact develop underlying theory nurture collaboration between traditionally separate disciplines understand information and computation as intrinsic components of a broad array of natural and engineered systems tackle challenging and fundamental problems with the potential for long-term and real-world impact develop underlying theory nurture collaboration between traditionally separate disciplines The graduate computer science option is primarily oriented toward Ph.D. research. Students complete advanced coursework to achieve a breadth of knowledge in the core areas of computer science, and specialized coursework in their intended research area as directed by their research advisor and the graduate option representative. The M.S. degree entails a thesis and coursework and is normally awarded in the first two years as part of the overall progress toward the Ph.D. The department expects Ph.D. students to achieve: a thorough understanding of the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of computer science, cutting-edge knowledge in the area of research specialization, the ability to identify, formulate, and tackle problems at the research frontiers in the area of specialization, success and originality in the formulation, analysis, and solution of a problem that is significant to the area of research specialization, experience in critically evaluating computer science research, experience in effectively communicate their ideas in writing and in oral presentations. a thorough understanding of the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of computer science, cutting-edge knowledge in the area of research specialization, the ability to identify, formulate, and tackle problems at the research frontiers in the area of specialization, success and originality in the formulation, analysis, and solution of a problem that is significant to the area of research specialization, experience in critically evaluating computer science research, experience in effectively communicate their ideas in writing and in oral presentations. Master's students are expected to achieve a thorough understanding of the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of computer science, and have gained significant knowledge in the area of research specialization through their coursework, and to demonstrate promise in independent research through an original thesis. Aims and Scope of the Graduate Program Graduate Option Rep Prof. Chris Umans Options Administrator Maria Lopez mlopezcms.caltech.edu Graduate study in computer science is oriented principally toward PhD research: there is no admission to the MS program as the degree objective. The course work and thesis requirements for the MS degree are only a required part of the PhD program. Students entering the graduate program with an M.S. degree from another school may transfer credit for course work as appropriate. A student may petition the option representative to have a prior MS thesis or equivalent accepted in lieu of a Caltech M.S. thesis; no Caltech MS will be granted in this case. The PhD program requires a minimum of three academic years of residence. The MS should be completed within the first two years. Students must maintain high academic standards during their graduate residence. A students PhD research must exhibit originality in the formulation, analysis, and solution of a problem that is significant to the field of study. The option representative and executive officers are available to discuss concerns regarding academic progress. Masters Degree There are five requirements to fulfill in order to receive a MS in Computer Science: Total units. Completion of a minimum of 135 units of courses numbered 100 or greater, including MS thesis research (CS 180). The student will consult with the adviser to ensure balance in the course work. Advanced courses in computer science. Completion of a minimum of 54 units of CS courses numbered 100 or greater in addition to units earned for reading, research, projects, and the MS thesis. Units outside computer science. Completion of a minimum of 27 units outside computer science. Courses jointly listed with computer science cannot be used to fulfill this requirement. Breadth. Toward the end of the first year, all incoming students must successfully pass a diagnostics exam administered by the faculty. Its purpose is to ensure a solid and broad knowledge in computer science, and/or to direct the students to necessary courses and reading. MS thesis. At the end of the second year, students must have completed a minimum of 45 units of CS 180, had their MS thesis approved by a computer science faculty member, obtained the signature of a designated computer science faculty member on the MS candidacy form, and submitted a copy of the M.S. thesis submitted to the Office of the Dean of Graduate Studies no later than two weeks before the degree is to be conferred.

Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Candidacy. To be admitted to candidacy, a student must have completed the MS program, have entered upon a course of research approved by his or her thesis adviser, and have passed a candidacy oral examination. The candidacy oral examination will be administered by a committee that consists of four faculty, is approved by the option representative, and is chaired by the adviser. The examination will ascertain the students breadth and depth of preparation for research in the chosen area. The examination should be taken within the first three years. Advising and Thesis Supervision. In order to facilitate close supervision and a highly research-oriented environment, each student is admitted directly to an adviser and research group. A course of study is determined in consultation with the adviser. Occasionally students will be admitted into more than one group. Changes in affiliation may occur with the common consent of the student and the new adviser. Students meet regularly with their adviser throughout their time at Caltech, and are encouraged to do the same with other members of the faculty. Thesis and Final Examination. A final oral examination will be scheduled and given after the PhD thesis has been submitted for review to the students adviser and thesis committee; the latter consists of at least four faculty approved by the option representative, and is chaired by the adviser. The thesis examination is a defense of the thesis research and a test of the candidates knowledge in his or her specialized fields. Candidacy.

Graduate Programs Undergraduate Programs Course Info Student Organizations Faculty Directory Faculty Positions Alumni Spotlights Publications Contact EECS Faculty Directory Faculty Positions Alumni Spotlights Publications Contact EECS The Master's Degree The EECS master's degrees are primarily intended for students desiring to substantially advance their knowledge and skill in a field or fields of EECS. The relatively small investment in time to get a master's degree will lead to greater professional opportunities and significantly higher salaries. Overview of the Department With two master's programs within one department (CSE, ECE), EECS enables students to have a home in a degree program tailored closely to their interests, while having access to, and the benefits of, the full breadth of the EECS Department. For example, all EECS classes and faculty advisors are equally available to students in all two graduate programs, while the degree requirements are tailored to the specific program. The faculty of the EECS Department are organized in two divisions: Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). The CSE faculty have the primary responsibility for the CSE Graduate Program; the ECE faculty have the primary responsibility for the ECE Graduate Programs. Program Overview The master's degree requires successful completion of 30 credits of coursework. A thesis is optional. Students normally complete the master's degree in 1-2 years. The complete master's requirements can be found in the program guide for the program of interest: CSE, ECE. Students admitted to the master's program may apply to the doctoral program. Admission depends on academic qualifications as well as the availability of openings in the doctoral program. MS vs. MSE Degree The MS (Master's of Science) and MSE (Master's of Science in Engineering) degrees differ mainly in name. The degree requirements are the same. Students with a bachelor's degree in engineering can elect either degree. Students without an engineering bachelor's degree are eligible only for the MS. Transferring Credits A limited number of graduate credits earned elsewhere can be transferred to meet the coursework requirements for the master's degree. In addition, a course taken elsewhere that is equivalent to a course satisfying a degree requirement here can be used to satisfy the requirement, even if course credits are not transferred. However, such equivalancy will not reduce the total number of credit hours required. Apply to a Master's Program Information about applying to a master's program: CSE, ECE Financial Aid Information The EECS Department has limited financial aid to award to master's students at the time of application. On the other hand, master's students occasionally receive a research or teaching assistantship after they begin their studies. Master's students are encouraged to apply for fellowships from sources outside the University. See an overview of Financial Aid Resources for ECE and CSE.

Continuing students usually will follow the requirements in place when they entered UCSD, as described below, although they may opt to switch to the new requirements. NOTE: Students starting UCSD in Fall 2015 must follow the new requirements. Continuing students usually will follow the requirements in place when they entered UCSD, as described below, although they may opt to switch to the new requirements. CSE's master degree programs are designed to address a variety of post-graduate educational needs. As with our PhD programs, we offer majors in both computer science and computer engineering. Both majors permit pursuing one of three plans: Thesis Plan, Comprehensive Standard Plan, or Comprehensive Interdisciplinary Plan. Each plan requires forty-nine units of work.All three plans arehighly customizable to each student's goals, featuring a small core and a choice of area concentrations. These programs can be completed full-time or part-time by students working in industry. Students who are unsure of their interest in an MS degree can enroll in individual graduate classes through UCSD Extension Concurrent Enrollment Program (with permission of the instructor). A student may petition for a small number of these classes to transfer to their MS degree if they later apply to the MS program. Applications for admission to the MS program are considered annually. Admissions are effective the following Fall quarter. Excellent students who develop an interest in pursuing a PhD in the course of their MS are encouraged to apply to the PhD program. Computer Science Masters Program The department offers a Master's of Science in Computer Science. The degree is offered under the Thesis (Plan I), the Comprehensive Examination (Plan II), or Comprehensive Interdisiplinary (Plan II). Each plan requires forty-nine units of work. For full-time students, all the requirements can be completed within two years. Computer Science Core. All students must complete a set of three core courses that provide a foundation for the study of computer science. To sensitize students to issues on the forefront of CS research and expose students to the breadth of the faculty's expertise, students must also take a one-quarter research seminar that is offered at least every fall quarter. In particular, the following 4 courses must be taken for a letter grade (with the exception of CSE 292). Core Courses must be completed for a \"B\" average. CSE 202 CSE 221 CSE 240A CSE 292 CSE 202 CSE 221 CSE 240A CSE 292 Technical Concentration. To help students establish goals and obtain a coherent education, students choose an area of concentration. Each concentration is in an area in which the faculty has significant research expertise. The typical concentration is a collection of three courses designed to give the student in-depth training in a chosen field. Students must complete 12 units from one of the approved lists of courses in the following concentration areas, or design a personalized concentration with the help of a faculty member: Artificial Intelligence Bioinformatics Communication Networks Computer Architecture and Compilers Computer Graphics and Vision Cryptography and Security Database and Information Retrieval Design Automation for Microelectronic Designs Distributed Computing Embedded Systems and Software Interaction Design Parallel and Scientific Computing Software Engineering Storage Systems PhD Preparation Artificial Intelligence Bioinformatics Communication Networks Computer Architecture and Compilers Computer Graphics and Vision Cryptography and Security Database and Information Retrieval Design Automation for Microelectronic Designs Distributed Computing Embedded Systems and Software Interaction Design Parallel and Scientific Computing Software Engineering Storage Systems PhD Preparation C.S.

Location The University of Maryland, College Park, is the flagship campus of the University System of Maryland. One of the largest campuses in the US, it is located in the Washington, D.C. area, a traditional center for culture and science. The area has many internationally renowned museums, monuments, libraries, theaters, and performing arts organizations. Around the National Mall, at the center of the nation's capital, is a concentration of museums and monuments unlike anywhere in the world. More recently, the area has become a technology center, especially in computer networking, communications, Internet services, and biotechnology. The Washington area is one of the most verdant metropolitan areas in the US, with large areas devoted to wildlife refuges and scenic parks. Surrounding the Washington area are nearby state and national parks and waterways in Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia, from the Shenandoah and Appalachian Mountains to the Chesapeake Bay and Assateague seashores. The area enjoys a full four-season climate, yet the winters are mild relative to most places in the northern US. The average daytime temperature in winter usually above freezing, snow stays on the ground for at most a few weeks in the winter, and Spring starts early in March. 3. Research Opportunities With an annual research budget of several million dollars, theDepartment's research projectscover nearly every aspect of computer science, including: Artificial Intelligence Algorithms and Theory Big Data, Data Analytics, and Data Mining Bioinformatics Computational Audition Database Systems Distributed Systems Graphics and Visualization High-Performance Computing Human-Computer Interaction Location-Based Services and Search Machine Learning Natural Language Processing Networking Programming Languages Quantum Computing Scientific Computing and Numerical Analysis Security and Cryptography Software Engineering Systems Vision        The department's basic computing facility is provided by a network of several hundred workstations of Unix, Windows, and Mac flavors. Graduate students generally have at least one workstation per person. More specialized computing facilities include Unix-based open laboratory, Mac-based multimedia and robotics laboratory, Linux cluster, Alpha farm, SP-2, etc., some of which are operated by sister research units on campus. In addition, the campus-wide Office of Information Technology operates open workstation labs, mostly for class use. The Computer Science Department has close ties to various research units on campus, providing faculty and students opportunities for collaborative research projects and access to specialized research facilities. Among these units: The Center for Automation Research (CfAR)does research on advanced automation in business and industry. Computer Vision Laboratory (CVL)is considered one of the three best vision groups in the world.

Applications are evaluated on the basis of educational and work experience, recommendation letters, and test scores. The GeneralGRE(Graduate Record Examination) is required for all applicants. The average score for the General GRE is: Verbal - 158, Quantitative - 163, and Analytical - 5.0. International students requireTOEFL(Test of English as a Foreign Language). Undergraduate grade point averages are generally 3.5 or above. However, each applicant is considered individually, and reasonable exceptions can be made in particular cases. Only a small fraction of those who apply are admitted to the graduate program. Satisfying the minimum requirements does not guarantee admission. Both GPA and GRE scores of students admitted in recent years have been much higher than the average scores. The University of Marylands Graduate School accepts applications through its ApplyYourself/Hobsons application system. Before completing the application, applicants are asked to check the Admissions Requirements site for specific instructions. As required by the Graduate School, all application materials are to be submitted electronically: Graduate application Transcripts Statement of purpose Letters of recommendation Program/Department supporting documents (as applicable) Non-refundable application fee ($75) for each program to which an applicant applies Graduate application Transcripts Statement of purpose Letters of recommendation Program/Department supporting documents (as applicable) Non-refundable application fee ($75) for each program to which an applicant applies The electronic submission of application materials helps expedite the review of an application. Completed applications are reviewed by an admissions committee in each graduate degree program. The recommendations of the committees are submitted to the Dean of the Graduate School, who will make the final admission decision. Students seeking to complete graduate work at the University of Maryland for degree purposes must be formally admitted to the Graduate School by the Dean. To ensure the integrity of the application process, the University of Maryland authenticates submitted materials through TurnItIn for Admissions. Information for International Graduate Students The University of Maryland is dedicated to maintaining a vibrant international graduate student community. The office of International Students and Scholars Services (ISSS) is a valuable resource of information and assistance for prospective and current international students. International applicants are encouraged to explore the services they offer, and contact them with related questions. The University of Maryland Graduate School offers admission to international students based on academic information; it is not a guarantee of attendance. Admitted international students will then receive instructions about obtaining the appropriate visa to study at the University of Maryland which will require submission of additional documents. Please see the Graduate Admissions Process for International applicants for more information. Contact Applicants are encouraged to contact the Hobsons online applications helpdesk for any technical issues. For questions related to the admissions process, prospective students may contact the Graduate School. Please Note Please Note  Applications and all supporting documents must be submitted by December 15 in order to be considered for the following Fall semester. Foreign students are urged to submit applications early, because processing takes longer than for US applicants. GRE examinations must be taken by November in order for the scores to arrive before admissions decisions are made. Applicants for Fall will be notified of their admission status approximately the first week of March. The Spring Semester application deadline is October 1.NOTE: Only those who are already students at the University of Maryland, College Park, are eligible to apply for the Spring Semester. Admission cannot be deferred. Applicants must indicate the semester in which they wish to begin the program. If an applicant does not enroll in the semester admitt, the offer of admission is voided. If an applicant decides to enter the program at a later time, a new application must be submitted. 5.

Lane Associate Professor of Practice, CIS Email | Website Contact: cggt@cis.upenn.edu  Computer Graphics and Game Technology Program Overview Interactive entertainment and computer-animated visual effects are now part of our mainstream culture. Creating such computer-generated imagery, however, is no trivial task. It requires a delicate blending of art with science by teams of highly skilled professionals, including artists, animators, writers, designers, engineers and software developers working long hours with cutting-edge technology and tools. Currently there are very few academic programs at four-year research universities adequately preparing students for such positions. The Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Graphics and Game Technology (CGGT) was created specifically to address this need. Program Overview The CGGT program was established in 2004. The goal of the program is to expose recent graduates, as well as individuals returning from industry, to state-of-the-art graphics and animation technologies, as well as interactive media design principles, product development methodologies and engineering entrepreneurship. The CGGT program prepares students for positions requiring multidisciplinary skills such as designers, technical animators and directors and game programmers. Students in the CGGT program use the equipment and resources available through the SIG Center for Computer Graphics. Opportunities for specialization are provided in such core areas as art and animation, creative design, animation and simulation technology, human/computer interfaces and production management. Who Should Apply? Students seeking admission to the program are assumed to have a bachelor's degree in either Computer Science or Engineering. Students seeking admission with non-computer science and/or engineering undergraduate backgrounds will require a minimum of two years to complete the program. The first year will be spent in the Department's Master of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT) program; upon satisfactory completion of the MCIT program, the student may pursue the Computer Graphics and Game Technology degree. Such students, having taken a total of 16 courses, will receive two degrees: a Master of Computer and Information Technology and a Master of Science and Engineering in Computer Graphics and Game Technology. Penn Advantage Since 1975, the Center for Human Modeling and Simulation (HMS) has been a leader in the fields of 3D computer graphics, human simulation and the behavioral animation of embodied intelligent agents. The lab has achieved international recognition for its research and is well known for the \"Jack\" software, a procedural character animation system used in both private sector and government applications. Computer Graphics Penn alumni have been influential in computer graphics applications around the world, and include industry leaders such as Nick Foster of PDI/DreamWorks (\"Shrek\") and Cary Philips at Industrial Light and Magic (ILM), who are winners of Academy Awards for Technical Achievement. The SIG Center for Computer Graphics includes a state-of-the-art motion capture studio and high performance NVidia GPU processors. This lab houses both the HMS Center and ViDi, the Digital Visualization Center. It fosters a collegial and open atmosphere in which faculty, staff, and students interact and collaborate. Doctoral students are often teamed with CGGT students and students from the affiliated undergraduate Digital Media Design (DMD) program to conduct cutting-edge research and produce animated demonstrations highlighting their results. The continued industry need for well-rounded designers, programmers and technical directors who understand both the art and science of producing visual media and interactive content has led to great success with graduates from both the CGGT and DMD programs finding employment at companies such as Pixar, DreamWorks, Disney, Electronic Arts, Microsoft, Sony, Activision, Blue Sky Entertainment.

The MCIT program stems from a belief that advanced computer science coursework for people with undergraduate degrees in other diverse fields leads to highly successful career paths. Our graduates and their careers today stand as strong proof to this philosophy. Within the realm of academia, pursuing further advanced study in computer science is also an option open to MCIT graduates. Due to the goals and nature of the MCIT program, it is strictly for applicants with limited or no past experience in computer science. Candidates with an undergraduate major in Computer Science or closely related fields, or with substantial software development experience, should consider applying to the Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) program instead. Our Students Our students come from backgrounds as diverse as chemistry, history, medicine, law, mathematics, literature and fine arts. However, what they all share in common is immense drive and a strong desire to succeed in the field of computing and technology. With their unique combination of skills in Computer Science and non-Computer Science fields, they have gone on to succeed in both technical and interdisciplinary careers. Moreover, current students are very well connected with our tight-knit alumni community, and the MCIT network is growing with each graduating batch. Contact Dr. Chris Murphy to speak with a current MCIT student. What Should I Expect After Graduation? MCIT graduates emerge from the program as well-rounded and versatile individuals, and find themselves in a prime position in the job market. Past students have gone on to work in various roles at large companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook, as well as at entrepreneurial start-ups and smaller-sized companies across the nation. Moreover, with their diverse backgrounds, our students are also in a unique position to fill technical jobs in industries such as bioinformatics, medicine, finance, telecommunications, media and many others. A significant proportion of our students do internships in the summer between their first and second years of study, and these internships often lead to full-time employment offers. Our accessible and tight-knit alumni network, together with Penns stellar Career Services and our supportive, reputed faculty, ensure that MCIT graduates are exposed to the many doors that are open to them after graduation.

There are many attractive features that characterize all the graduate programs at Brown. In addition, our master's program has several advantages that you may not find at other universities: All our courses are taught by the same people who earn the department its reputation for innovative education and research. Indeed, our faculty see research and education as closely interlinked. As a result, our courses not only offer a solid foundation, but are also forward-looking: you will routinely be exposed to ideas here that represent where industry is headed in coming years. The program has multiple tracks that make it easy for you to customize your route to the degree to your particular educational needs. Those looking to complete a more research-oriented degree can write a master's thesis. Those who want a research experience without the full burden of a thesis, or would like to implement a large software project instead of conducting novel research, can choose the project option. Finally, people who already have significant project experience in industry (and perhaps some research experience also) can opt for the coursework-only master's. Our strong industrial partnerships will help you better learn about industry's needs and directions, and will expose you to novel and unique opportunities. In addition, several professors from all across the department's groups work closely with industry (regional and beyond) and the government, so you will be able to sharpen your skills here on problems that bring research ideas and methods to bear on problems of practical value. To learn more about our graduate programs in general, including our research groups, our innovative multidisciplinary offerings, and much more, please see the pages on our graduate program. To apply to our Sc.M. program, please see the separate information on master's applications. To ask questions not answered there or on our FAQ, you can email scm_info@cs.brown.edu. Graduate students who wish to transfer graduate credit earned at another institution should download the Registrar's transfer from, found here. Once you have filled out the form, please submit it to the Faculty and Student Affairs Manager, Lauren Clarke, and she will get the requisite signatures on your behalf.

Thesis Option Plan of Study Advisory Committee Ethics Requirement Communication Requirement Courses and Grade Requirements Up to six semester-hours of credit for graduate courses taken at other institutions may be transferred with the approval of the Graduate Committee and the Graduate School. The grades must be A or B or the equivalent. Application for transfer is made when theplan of studyis submitted for approval. Students may ask the Graduate Committee to accept equivalent graduate courses taken at other institutions in lieu of at most two of the above courses. Instructions on Course Transfer Courses used to fulfill the requirements for other degrees (at Purdue or elsewhere) are not eligible for use on master's plans of study, except that courses used for a doctoral degree may be used on a master's plan of study provided the doctoral plan of study does not include any course used for any other master's degree. For the Non-Thesis Option Three core courses:CS 50200 or 56500, CS 50300 or 53600, and CS 58000. These represent the areas Systems I, Systems II, and Algorithms in theAreas and Courses Table. Four other courses from thetable. These must include courses from at least two areas other than Systems I, Systems II, and Algorithms. Three more Level 5 or 6 courses (not necessarily in Computer Science), at most two of which may be individual study courses. Approved Courses List For theThesis Option Three core courses:CS 50200 or 56500, CS 50300 or 53600, and CS 58000. These represent the areas Systems I, Systems II, and Algorithms in theAreas and Courses Table. Four other courses from thetable. These must include courses from at least two areas other than Systems I, Systems II, and Algorithms. One more Level 5 or 6 course (not necessarily in Computer Science), which maynotbe an individual study course. At least six credit hours of CS 69800, Research. M.S. Thesis. The thesis must be presented in an oral defense before the advisory committee. back to top Plan of Study Courses used to fulfill degree requirements must be listed on a plan of study and submitted for approval by the Graduate Committee and the Graduate School well before the final session. Grades in the A range (A+, A, A-) or B range are expected, but one or two grades in the C range may be accepted if they are compensated by grades in the A range (regardless of + and -). Other grades are unacceptable. The GPA of the courses on the plan must be at least 3.0. CS 69800, Research. M.S. Thesis, is not listed on the plan of study. Master's programs usually take three or four semesters. The practical maximum load is four courses per semester and two in the summer session. Students with assistantships rarely take more than three courses per semester and one in the summer session. Completing a master's program within twelve months is sometimes possible for well-prepared, industrious students. Instructions for Filing a Plan of Study Graduation Deadline Calendar: https://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/about/calendar/deadlines.html back to top Advisory Committee For students in a non-thesis master's program, the advisory committee is determined by the graduate committee. For students in a thesis master's program, the advisory committee consists of the supervisor of the research plus two or more other faculty members agreed upon by the student and the supervisor. Qualified faculty from other departments may serve on the committee but may not form a majority of it. back to top Ethics Requirement All MS students must fulfill an ethics requirement. This is currently to be fulfilled by attending the ethics lecture of the Research Seminar for First-Year Graduate Students once during the first year. The seminar (CS 59100 RS1) is offered only in the fall semester. An announcement of the date, time, and place of the lecture is sent out ahead of time. Attendance is taken at the lecture. MS students cannot register for the seminar: they attend just the one lecture. All graduate students must also pass the responsible conduct of research (RCR) for Undergraduate Students on-line test atwww.citiprogram.organd forward the certificate to the Graduate Office at grad-info@cs.purdue.edu with the subject \"Ethics Requirement\". (Go to www.citiprogram.org; Register with Purdue University as your Organization Affiliation; Click on \"Add a Course or Update Learner Groups\"; Leave Q1 Blank, Check RCR for Undergraduate Students on Q2, put Not at this time for everything else.) at grad-info@cs.purdue.edu ; Further information on Responsible Conduct of Research: http://www.purdue.edu/gradschool/research/rcr/index.html back to top Communication Requirement All MS students that entered after spring 2008 must demonstrate effectiveness in communication. For students using the thesis option, this will be assessed in the normal course of their program. For students using the non-thesis option this can be assessed on the basis of presentations and papers in courses. Students should ask faculty members from whom they have taken a course and in whose judgment they have demonstrated effectiveness in communication to inform the graduate office by sending an e-mail to grad-info@cs.purdue.edu with the subject \"Communication Requirement\". Otherwise, the student must write a technical essay at the beginning of the final semester and submit it to the chair of the Graduate Committee for evaluation. A research paper may also be used if the student is the sole author. back to top Changes in Requirements These requirements apply to all students entering or reentering the Department of Computer Sciences at West Lafayette (\"the Department\") as degree-seeking graduate students in the summer session of 2013 or later.2008 master's degree requirements Students are governed by the degree requirements in effect when they enter the Department as degree-seeking students. Students who wish to take advantage of subsequent changes may apply to the Graduate Committee to be governed byall degree requirementsin effect at a specified subsequent time. Choosing features from different sets of requirements is not permitted. For students re-entering, the date of the most recent re-entry determines the degree requirements. The above requirements for the master's program may change without notice. back to top Areas and Courses Table Bioinformatics CS 57900 CS 57300, 54701*, 57800** *CS 54701 was CS 59000 008, Information Retrieval, in spring 2009. **CS 57800 was CS 59000 005, Statistical Machine Learning, in fall 2009 and CS 59000 MLO, Statistical Machine Learning, in spring and fall 2011. *** when taught by a professor whose primary appointment is in Computer Sciences.
